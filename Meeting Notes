3) The task for 1st week is to look around for research papers and datasets, and try to think of different ways in which we could solve the problem.
    For the 1st week we dont want you to write any code but explore stuff and come up with ideas
    Also along with accuracy of the model , the size of the model is also a very important factor for us
    
4) We would like to have a weekly meeting with you all so we need to decide on the timings
